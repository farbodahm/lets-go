**Student-Baker Problem**
==============

Some students are studing for their OS exam. Every student can study **only if** she/he has a loaf of bread. Every student is running a loop like this:
```
while (you'd like) {
    pick a loaf of bread;

    study while eating;
}
```

If a student finds that there are no breads any more, she/he will call the baker to prepare breads and meanwhile, she/he will sleep until the breads get available again.

Assume that we have 10 loaves of bread at the beginning and every time that the baker is called, he bakes 10 loaves of bread.

Write the code related to students and the baker and then run a simulation for your answer.
