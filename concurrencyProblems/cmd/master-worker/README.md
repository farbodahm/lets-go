**Master-Worker Problem**
==============

1) Create two go-routines, which are running a loop with 10 iterations. Find a way to
make the execution slower.

2) How do you get data from those routines in the “main thread” ?

3) Receive 10 individual strings from each go-routine.

4) How could you stop the running go-routines from the “main thread” ?

5) How would you test your answer? (Think about solutions or even implement them!)
